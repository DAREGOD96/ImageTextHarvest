## About the Project

The project involves the implementation of a generative AI application designed for extracting essential information images.Following extraction, users have the capability to seamlessly insert the gleaned information into a designated database automatically. The system incorporates an edit option, affording users the opportunity to rectify any potential errors made by the model and make necessary corrections. This project aims to streamline the process of information extraction and database management, demonstrating the potential for increased efficiency and accuracy in handling data. The emphasis on user-friendly functionality, coupled with the capability for error correction, enhances the overall utility and reliability of the application.
